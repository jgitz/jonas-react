.... now in the project we want to create an app component....

** we can EITHER CREATE a separate APP.JS file in src folder.... OR WRITE APP COMPONENT FUNCTION inside the INDEX.JS ITSELF 

  **** we are writing APP FUNCTION inside the INDEX.JS FOLDER 


- to create APP COMPOENENT inside index.js.... goto index.js 

  - write function named APP with a demo return 

  **naming convention of FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT FILES as well as FUNCTION NAMES is PASCAL CASE

  ** the FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS are JSX FILES.... hence.... if there are BLOCKS of CODES as return of a function.... they are WRAPPED IN () INSTEAD OF {}.... because it's the JSX SYNTAX
