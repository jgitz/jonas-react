.... the return of a component function returns JSX CODES.....

.... but THE COMPONENT RETURN should always have only ONE ROOT ELEMENT.... 

.... using DIV as ROOT ELEMENT will have SIDE-EFFECTS in the UI DESIGN.... 

... so the SOLUTION is to use REACT FRAGMENTS 

- REACT FRAGMENTS: is a NAMELESS ELEMENT TAG that is commonly used as ROOT ELEMENT inside the RETURN to WRAP JSX CODES.... 

  - SYNTAX 1: 

    function component() {
      return (
        <>
          JSX CODES 
        </>
      )
    }

      ** <></> is called the REACT FRAGMENTS

  - SYNTAX 2: is used when we want to add ATTRIBUTES such as KEY(..for looping) to the react fragment elements



    function component() {

      return (

        <React.Fragment key={<unique value>}>

          JSX CODES
        
        </React.Fragment>

      )
    }

    **** make sure you IMPORT React to use this in the component file 

  ** REACT FRAGMENT ELEMENT is INVISIBLE in the DOM
