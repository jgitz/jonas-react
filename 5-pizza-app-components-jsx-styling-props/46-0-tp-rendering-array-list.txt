.... in most cases.... the data to be used in for UI UPDATES comes in the form of ARRAY of OBJECTS.... to JSX {} cannot use LOOP methods to loop over array... but can use ARRAY MAP METHOD

- BEST PRACTICE when using ARRAY map method 

  - always pass in the ARRAY ITEM OBJECT as PROPS to the CHILD COMPONENT 

  - KEY PROP: is a REACT specific prop for performance optimisation.. its important to PASS IN the KEY PROP with a UNIQUE value from the ARRAY OBJECT ITEM

  - alway use SEMANTIC HTML TAGS like <ul></ul> and <li></li> when needed

- in pizza app.... refactor the code such that... render PIZZA list using a SINGLE ARRAY MAP method
