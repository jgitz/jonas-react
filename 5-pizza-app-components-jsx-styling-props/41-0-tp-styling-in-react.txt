.... styles can be added in react in 3 ways 

  1) INLINE STYLING: using JSX like below 

    - for eg:
    
       <h1 style= {{color: 'green', fontSize: '8px'}}></h1>

  2) add STYLE OBJECT as a VARIABLE inside the component file.... and use it inside the JSX INLINE STYLE ATTRIBUTE 

    - for eg: 

      const style_variable = {
        color: 'red',
        backgroundColor: 'green'
      }


      function App() {
        return (
          <h1 style={style_variable}></h1>
        )
      }

      ***** observe there is no DOUBLE CURLY {} for STYLE ATTRIBUTE VALUE 

  3) EXTERNAL CSS FILES: styling can be added by importing EXTERNAL CSS FILE into the component and use the RELEVENT CLASS in the className attribute 

    - for eg 

      import ./<css_file.css>;

      function App() {
        return {

          <div className='container'></div>

        }
      }

      ** CONTAINER CLASS is from the IMPORTED CSS FILE 

    4) STYLED COMPONENT (LATER): when we import css file and use the classes to components.... these CLASSES are GLOBAL... as every other component can also use these same classes.... BUT for BIGGER APPS.... COMPONENT SPECIFIC CLASSES should be there which cannot be applied to other components.... this is acheived using STYLED COMPONENTS??
