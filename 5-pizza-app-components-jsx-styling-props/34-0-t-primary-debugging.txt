... Primary debugging if NO UPDATES are made to UI ARE 

1) check if the APP is RUNNING in the TERMINAL 

2) RELOAD the browser as AUTOMATIC UPDATES (aka HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT) can FAIL at times 

3) check for ESLINT ERROR UNDERLINES in the witten CODE  

  ** ESLINT ERRORS will be displayed in PROBLEM TAB of the VSCODE INTEGRATED TERMINAL 

  ** ESLINT is ENABLED by DEFAULT in CREATE-REACT-APP 

4) sometimes the code WON'T run if there is any error in EXTENSIONS used such as PRETTIER, ESLINT etc.... to check for errors in EXTENSION TASKS.... 

  - open OUTPUT TAB of VSCODE INTEGRATED TERMINAL

  - select EXTENSION NAME from the dropdown 

  ** scroll through the terminal and check for any error 

**** more debugging using REACT DEV TOOLS will be discussed later
