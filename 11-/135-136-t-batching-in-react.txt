- BATCHING: is a process where REACT ony does a SINGLE RENDER form MULTIPLE STATE UPDATED 

  - for example: if there is a handler function with 3 SET-STATE METHODS to update the state.... then REACT WON'T RENDER the ui 3 TIMES.... instead it BATCHES THE 3 SET-STATE methods and only render it once 

  ** in SOME RARE CASES.... we DON'T WANT AUTOMATIC BATCHING... so in that case WRAP the SET-STATE-UPDATE METHOD inside the FOLLOWING METHOD 

    ReactDOM.flushSync(<set-state>)

  ** to update the state on CURRENT VALUE use CALLBACK FUNCTION in the SET-STATE METHOD 

    setState((state) => {
      codes
    })

  - BATCHING in REACT 17 V/S REACT 18 

    - AUTOMATIC BATCHING in EVENT HANDLER FUNCTIONS

      - react 17: YES
      - react 18: yes 

    - AUTOMATIC BATCHING in TIMEOUT METHODS

      - react 17: NO 
      - react 18: yes 

    - AUTOMATIC BATCHING in PROMISES

      - react 17: NO
      - react 18: yes 

    - AUTOMATIC BATCHING in .addEventListner (NATIVE EVENTS)

      - react 17: NO 
      - react 18: yes 

***** if you do a CONSOLE.LOG of a STATE IMMEDIATELY AFTER using SET-STATE method.... you WON'T get the UPDATED STATE VALUE.... because UPDATING STATE in REACT is ASYNCHRONOUS
