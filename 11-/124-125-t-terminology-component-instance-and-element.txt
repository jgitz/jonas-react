1) COMPONENT: is a simple function that returns a JSX 

2) COMPONENT INSTANCE: whenever a COMPONENT TAG is used MULTIPLE TIMES.... MULTIPLE INSTANCES of the COMPONENT (FUNCTION) is triggered....

  ** each COMPONENT INSTANCEs have SEPARATE LIFECYCLE, STATES and PROPS

  ** you can see COMPONENT INSTANCE DATA in the console by using 

    console.log(<Component Tag/>)

      ** we can see component details such as PROPS OBJECT

3) REACT ELEMENTS: whenever a component is used.... the JSX returned by the component function is CONVERTED to REACT ELEMENT.... 

  - REACT ELEMENT is an IMMUTABLE JS OBJECT in react memory 

    - REACT ELEMENT OBJECT contains ALL the INFORMATION NECESSARY to create the DOM HTML ELEMENT for the COMPONENT INSTANCE 

  - JSX is converted to react element by using React.createElement() function in the backend 

4) DOM ELEMENTS (HTML) : DOM ELEMENTS are the ACTUAL REPRESENTATION of the UI in HTML ELEMENT FORM.... and DOM ELEMENTS are built from the REACT ELEMENT OBJECT DATA
