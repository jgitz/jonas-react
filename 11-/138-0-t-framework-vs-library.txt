- FRAMEWORKS: is a COMPLETE PACKAGE that includes every tool that you need to build a web application

  - FRAMEWORKS include tools for implementing features like 

    - http request handling

    - routing 

    - styling 

    - form management ??

    - etc 

  - example for frameworks:

    - VUE 
    - ANGULAR 
    - SVELTE 

    - NEXT JS (REACT BASED)
    - REMIX (REACT BASED)
    - GATSBY 

  ** DISADVANTAGES:

    - developers are stuck with TOOLS and CONVENTIONS of the framework

- LIBRARIES: are package of code which only does ONE FUNCTION 

  - REACT is a VIEW LIBRARY to RENDER VIEWS... for any other features.... we need to add SEPARATE LIBRARIES

  - ADVANTAGES:

    - freedom to choose libraries you like

  - DISADVANTAGES: 

    - difficult to learn all libraries and keeping up with the UPDATES happening on the libraries used
