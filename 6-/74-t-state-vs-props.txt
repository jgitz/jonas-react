** State is INTERNAL DATA owned by the COMPONENT INSIDE which IT IS DEFINED 

  * PROPS is EXTERNAL DATA OWNED by the PARENT COMPONENT and is PASSED INTO a CHILD COMPONENT 

** STATE variable is similar to COMPONENT MEMORY 

  * PROPS is similar to FUNCTION PARAMETERS 

** STATE CAN BE UPDATED from the COMPONENT in which it is defined 

  * PROPS inside a CHILD COMPONENT is READ-ONLY and CANNOT be MODIFIED by the CHILD COMPONENT.... it can ONLY be MODIFIED inside the PARENT COMPONENT

** UPDATING state will cause RE-RENDER of the COMPONENT in which it is defined. 

  * UPDATING a PROP inside PARENT COMPONENT will TRIGGER RE-RENDER in BOTH PARENT and CHILD COMPONENTS
