..... hooks in REACT are simple FUNCTIONS that are INBUILT to react.... HOOKS are functions with PREFIX "USE".... eg: useState, useEffect, useReducer

** HOOKS can ONLY BE DEFINED at TOP LEVEL of the REACT COMPONENT FUNCTION.... i.e BEFORE the RETURN of the COMPONENT FUNCTION 

**** HOOKS CANNOT be DEFINED INSIDE 

  - ANOTHER FUNCTION
  - IF ELSE STATEMENTS 

  .. etc 

  ** HOOKS SHOULD be DEFINED STAND ALONE at the TOP LEVEL of a COMPONENT FUNCTION
