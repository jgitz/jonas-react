..... a UI is formed by COMBINING several COMPONENT VIEWS....

- STATE VARIABLE/COMPONENT STATE: allows you to STORE DATA INSIDE A COMPONENT which is required to be PERSISTED throughout the LIFECYCLE of the application.

  ** we RENDER COMPONENT VIEW based on CHANGE of data in the state variable

  ** when the DATA in the STATE VARIABLE gets UPDATED.... the COMPONENT VIEW RE-RENDERS... this is the BEHAVIOUR of REACT 

  ** so STATE VARIABLE HELPS to PERSIST LOCAL STATE VARIABLE DATA between RERENDERS 

- FUNCTIONS of STATE VARIABLE 

  1) UPDATE COMPONENT VIEW by RE-RENDERING it 

  2) PERSIST LOCAL COMPONENT DATA between RENDERS
