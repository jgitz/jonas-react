.... form handle function can be specified to the form element in two ways 

  1) using ON SUBMIT ATTRIBUTE in the FORM TAG 

  2) using ON CLICK ATTRIBUTE inside the SUBMIT BUTTON ELEMENT in the form 

    ** onClick CAN BE ADDED to ANY JSX ELEMENT like DIV, P etc 


.... the difference between these two is that 

- ON SUBMIT will work when hitting ENTER BUTTON on the form element 

- ON CLICK will ONLY WORK if we CLICK the SUBMIT BUTTON 


**** we CANNOT?? add ON-CLICK ATTRIBUTE to a COMPONENT TAG.... it can only be added to HTML TAG 

  ** instead we must define the relevant STATE, and HANDLE-FUNCTIONS in the PARENT COMPONENT FUNCTION of the COMPONENT TAG and PASS IT AS PROPS..... on the COMPONENT TAG FUNCTION... use ON-CLICK on the RELEVANT HTML TAG and assign the HANDLE FUNCTION (PROP) as the value
