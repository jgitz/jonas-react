- onClick: takes a function as value and triggers the function  when the HTML TAG is clicked 

- onSubmit: takes a function as value and triggers the function when we click ENTER BUTTON after filling the form 

- onChange: if you need to do some operations when VALUE of an JSX element like <input> CHANGES.... we use "onChange" attribute inside the HTML TAG 

  - syntax eg: 

    <input onChange={(e) => {
      codes
    }}>

    ** the handler function assigned to ON CHANGE ATTRIBUTE always takes CHANGE EVENT (e) as argument

- onMouseEnter : takes function as value and triggers the function when the MOUSE ENTERS the HTML ELEMENT

- onMouseLeave : takes function as value and triggers the function when the MOUSE LEAVES the HTML ELEMENT 


**** ALL EVENTS CAN ONLY?? be added to HTML ELEMENT TAGS and  WON'T WORK on COMPONENT TAGS
