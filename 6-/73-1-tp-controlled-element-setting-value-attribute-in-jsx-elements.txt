...in order to create a DYNAMIC WEBSITE using react.... we often need to DYNAMICALLY change VALUES of JSX ELEMENTs like INPUT ELEMENT....

.... in VANILLA JS.... the VALUE of a TARGET ELEMENT is stored in DOM..... 

..... BUT in REACT.....we use CONTROLLED ELEMENTS...i.e... the VALUE of a JSX ELEMENT is manipulated using STATES.... it involves THREE STEPS 

  1) inside the COMPONENT FUNCTION we need to create a STATE to store the VALUE we want to add to the JSX ELEMENT 

  2) in the JSX ELEMENT... ASSIGN the STATE VARIABLE to the VALUE ATTRIBUTE

  3) on the JSX ELEMENT.... use "onChange" attribute.... and assign a handler function.... inside use the setState() to set the value to e.target.value...

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

... in the INPUT ELEMENT of the form.... write codes to set INPUT VALUE using USE STATE and ON CHANGE....

... do the same for SELECT JSX ELEMENT....
  
**** in the select option e.target.value is NOT NUMBER but STRING NUMBER.... so convert it to NUMBER TYPE USING "Number()"
