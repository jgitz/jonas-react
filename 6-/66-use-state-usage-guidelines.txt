- When to use USE STATE and BEST PRACTICES 

  - use USE STATE only for the data A COMPONENT NEEDS to REMEMBER OVER TIME 

  - use STATES when your UI want to DYNAMICALLY change according to a DATA 

  - UPDATION of state should be used inside an EVENT HANDLER function using SET STATE FUNCTION 

  **** for DATA that SHOULD NOT trigger RE-RENDERS.... DON'T USE STATE..... use REGULAR VARIABLE instead...


**** STATE of a COMPONENET is ISOLATED from the SAME state on a DIFFERENT COMPONENT.....
