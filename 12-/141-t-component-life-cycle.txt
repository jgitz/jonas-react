.... each COMPONENT INSTANCE has a LIFE-CYCLE where it go-through MANY PHASES.... there are THREE PHASES 

1) MOUNT/RENDER PHASE: is the phase where a component INSTANCE is RENDERED for the FIRST TIME with its PROPS and STATES 

2) RE-RENDER PHASE: is the phase where a component instance RE-RENDERS due to any ONE of the BELOW REASONS: 

  - STATE CHANGE 

  - PROPS CHANGE 

  - PARENT COMPONENT RE-RENDERING 

  - CONTEXT CHANGE?? (LATER..)

3) UNMOUNT PHASE: is the phase where the component INSTANCE is DESTROYED and REMOVED 

  - STATES and PROPS are also destroyed 


**** NOT ALL COMPONENTS are made to go through RE-RENDER PHASE..... some components are designed to MOUNT and immediately UNMOUNT
