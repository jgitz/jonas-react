.... most commonly used scenario of USE-EFFECT is to use it to FETCH data from a URL.... a while back we used FETCH method with .then method to get back data from the url endpoint.... 

.... NOW instead of .THEN CHAIN we use ASYNC AWAIT to handle FETCH calls to an END POINT.... 

.... in REACT APP'S FETCH calls are COMMONLY given inside USE-EFFECT.... but THE EFFECT FUNCTION CANNOT BE MADE ASYNC (the function must be made ASYNC inorder to use AWAIT inside the function).... 

... to overcome this we do the following step....

1) define the USE-EFFECT HOOK.... with a NORMAL EFFECT FUNCTION 

2) INSIDE the EFFECT-FUNCTION... CREATE ANOTHER FUNCTION and MAKE IT ASYNC 

3) write the FETCH CALL in the SECOND ASYNC function 

4) OUTSIDE THE ASYNC FUNCTION (..I.E INSIDE the EFFECT FUNCTION ).... INVOKE the ASYNC FUNCTION 



***** always give AWAIT to BOTH const RES and const DATA......

***** NEVER CONSOLE.LOG any STATE VARIABLES... just AFTER SETTING IT with SET-STATE.... SET-STATE is ASYNCHRONOUS.... hence ony THE STALE-STATE/INITIAL STATE VALUE will be consoled.... always CONSOLE for CONST DATA VARIABLE to know if your API CALL WORKED
