.....TWO COMMON PLACES which are used IN REACT to ISOLATE SIDE-EFFECTS are 

  1) EVENT HANDLER FUNCTIONS 

  2) USE-EFFECT HOOK 

  ***** EVENT HANDLER FUNCTIONS are the MOST-PREFERRED way to make SIDE-EFFECTS in react... and DON'T OVER-USE USE-EFFECT HOOK

- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVENT-HANDLERS and USE-EFFECT HOOK 

  * EVENT HANDLER are  simple HANDLER FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED to EVENT PROPS such as onClick, onSubmit, onChange..... these functions hold codes that create SIDE-EFFECTS.... and this functions are ONLY INVOKED when the EVENT is TRIGGERED... eg BUTTON CLICK 

      ** USE-EFFECT hook is used to SYNCHRONIZE the COMPONENT with some EXTERNAL SYSTEM.... eg to sync with API DATA

      
  * EVENT HANDLER only gets activated when the EVENT is TRIGGERED 

      ** USE-EFFECT hook gets activated and runs the EFFECT FUNCTION on the INITIAL COMPONENT MOUNT PHASE as well as on RE-RENDERS (..if there are items in the DEPENDENCY ARRAY)....

  * EVENT HANDLER use is the most PREFEREED WAY to handle SIDE-EFFECTS in react 

      ** USE-EFFECT hooks SHOULD NOT be OVERUSED
