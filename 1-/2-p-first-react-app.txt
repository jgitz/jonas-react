.... before we dive into the details of react.... we are going to create a demo react app....

- GOALS:

  - to create a react app to show ADVICES/QUOTES obtained from the api link given below 

     	https://api.adviceslip.com/advice

      ** using FETCH, ASYNC, AWAIT 
      ** use .json()

  - the page should have a BUTTON.... which when clicked will display NEW ADVICES 

  - at the bottom.... the page should show the COUNT of CLICKS on the BUTTON 

  - the page should load with an ADVICE (..using useEffect hook )

  - on the SAME PAGE.... display ANOTHER COMPONENT to separately display the COUNT (use props)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- use VITE to set the server 

  - do :: npm create vite@latest ::

  - goto project folder and run 

    - :: npm i ::

    - to run react app in the browser do 

      :: npm run dev :: 

      ** click on the server link 

- inside project-folder/src 

  - clean up all codes inside APP.TSX 

  - delete

    - index.css (... also inside main.tsx... remove the import line for index.css)
    - app.css 

    ** as we are not using STYLING in this project 

- inside APP.TSX 

  - SETTING APP COMPONENT: create DEFAULT EXPORT FUNCTION named APP with a RETURN
