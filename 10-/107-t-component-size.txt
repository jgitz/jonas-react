.... COMPONENT SIZE are subjective to developers and the requirement.....

- components SHOULD NOT be VERY LARGE 

- components SHOULD NOT be VERY SMALL 

- ideal size of component is in between large and small 

- if a component has more than 4? PROPS it's better to SPLIT INTO smaller components 

- components can also be NON-REUSABLE 

- ITS BETTER to start building components RIGHT AWAY and SPLIT the REPEATING CODES into SEPARATE COMPONENT
