..... a simple classification of components catagorises them to THREE TYPES 

1) STATELESS/PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENT: 

  - has no state 
  
  - receives data as PROPS and renders the output 

  - usually SMALL and REUSABLE 

  - eg: LOGO component to display logo

2) STATEFUL COMPONENTS: 

  - have STATE 

  - can be reused 

3) STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS: 

  - COMPONENTS formed by COMBINING many other components 

  - USUALLY HUGE and NON-REUSABLE (.. there are EXCEPTIONS on size and reusability )

  - eg: PAGES, LAYOUTS, SCREENS??

** in our movie app component 

  - STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS = NAVBAR, APP, MAIN components 

  - STATE-LESS/PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENT = LOGO, NUM-RESULTS, MOVIE, WATCHED-SUMMARY, WATCHED-MOVIES-LIST, WATCHED-MOVIE

  - STATE-FUL COMPONENTS = SEARCH, LIST-BOX, MOVIE-LIST, WATCH-BOX
