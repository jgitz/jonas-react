- always CHAIN .SLICE() array method before SORT() as SORT METHOD MUTATES the original array 

- to sort string item ALPHABATICALLY use sort with LOCALA COMPARE FUNCTION like this 

  <array>.sort((a,b) => {
    return a.localeCompare(b)
  })

  ** here a and b are items of array which are STRINGS 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

.... now we want to sort the items in the list based on ITEM NAME, INPUT ORDER and PACKED STATUS 

- we implement this using ARRAY SORT METHOD 

- create a NEW STATE named ITEM-SORT-OPTION in PACKING LIST COMPONENT to store sort option 

- set sorting option ui using SELECT and OPTION html elements.... SET OPTION VALUES in VALUE ATTRIBUTE of OPTION ELEMENTS..... set VALUE ATTRIBUTE of SELECT OPTION to ITEM-SORT-OPTION STATE..... and use ON-CHANGE attribute on SELECT option to SET OPTION VALUE.... 

- map the the items based on a DERIVED STATE which is an array derived from the ITEMS ARRAY PROP inside the PACKING LIST COMPONENT 

- inside the PACKING LIST COMPONENT..... use 3 SEPARATE IF STATEMENTS to SORT THE ITEMS in the DERIVED STATE ARRAY
