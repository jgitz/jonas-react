... there are TWO TYPES of state....

  1) LOCAL STATE: 

    - state needed by only ONE or FEW COMPONENTS 

    - local state is defined inside the COMPONENT that uses the STATE.... the CHILD COMPONENTS can also access the state through PROPS 

    - ALWAYS start with using LOCAL STATE.... and MOVE it to GLOBAL STATE only when needed 

  2) GLOBAL STATE: 

    - state that is needed by MANY COMPONENTS 

    - this state should be accessible to EVERY COMPONENT in the application 

    - two popular tools used to create and manage  GLOBAL STATES are 

      1) CONTEXT API 

      2) REDUX
