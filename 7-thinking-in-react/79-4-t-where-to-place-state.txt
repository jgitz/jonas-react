... now we need to know WHERE to place the state based on the following scenarios 

- set state INSIDE the COMPONENT: if a state is used ONLY by a COMPONENT....the state should be set inside that component 

- set state inside PARENT COMPONENT and use PROPS if the state is needed by a CHILD COMPONENT 

- if the state is used by MULTIPLE SIBLING COMPONENTS.... then LIFT THE STATE up to the COMMON PARENT (..later)

- if a state is used by MULTIPLE COMPONENTS ALL OVER the component tree.... use GLOBAL STATE (..later)
