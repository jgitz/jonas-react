.... building web app in react is different from building it in vanilla js.... hence we've to approach differently inorder to develop UI using REACT 

- STEPS involved in THINKING IN REACT: 

  1) BREAK UI into COMPONENT and develop COMPONENT TREE  to set RELATIONSHIP b/w the components

    - how to make COMPONENTS REUSABLE 

    - how to ASSEBLE components to form UI 

  2) build web app with STATIC CODES using DUMMY DATA and NOT USING any STATES.. 

  3) STATE MANAGEMENT: 

    - Think about USING of STATES: 

      - WHERE to use STATES 

      - WHICH TYPE of STATE should be used.... LOCAL or GLOBAL tates 

      - WHERE to PLACE states 

    - ESTABLISH DATA FLOW: 

      - WHEN to use ONE-WAY DATA FLOW (parent-to child component)

      - HOW to establish CHILD TO PARENT COMMUNICATION 

      - HOW to ACCESS GLOBAL STATE
