- What are FEATURES of REACT? 

  1) COMPONENT BASED: components are the BUILDING BLOCKS of REACT APP... various components are COMBINED to render a web page in react 

    ** COMPONENT: are UI elements with its own DATA, LOGIC and APPEARANCE 

    ** REUSABLITY: components can be REUSED with new set of DATA 

  2) DECLARATIVE: react library is used to DESCRIBE the APPERANCE of the COMPONENt using DECLARATIVE SYNTAX called JSX

    ** VANILLA JS is IMPERATIVE as we've to MANUALLY SET THE UI using DOM MANIPULATION COMMANDS.... BUT in REACT.... the DOM OPERATIONS are ABSTRACTED....

    ** JSX: is a DECLARATIVE SYNTACTIC EXTENSION of JS which allows to combine HTML, CSS, JS as well as REFERENCING OTHER COMPONENTS 

  3) STATE DRIVEN: i.e UI gets RENDERED based on the STATE (...synonymous to DATA) CHANGES.... and whenever the STATE related to a UI gets UPDATED due to events like button click.... the react AUTOMATICALLY RE-RENDERS the UI with UPDATED STATE... 

  4) JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY: a library always only deals with ONE FUNCTIONALITY.... so REACT is a library that only deals with DESIGNING the UI/VIEW 

    ** to add OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES.... you need to install OTHER LIBRARIES 

    ** NEXTJS, REMIX, ANGULAR etc are FRAMEWORKS with INBUILT TOOLS/LIBRARIES for FULLSTACK DEVELOPMENT.... NEXTJS and REMIX are built ON TOP of REACT
