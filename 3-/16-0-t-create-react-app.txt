.... in the project we use create-react-app to get features such as ESLINT..... and in later project we'll use VITE 

- to create a react app using create-react app 

  :: npx create-react-app <app-name>::

- to run the app 

  :: npm run start :: or :: npm start ::

- folder structure 

  - SRC FOLDER: where we store component files 

  - PUBLIC FOLDER: where we store ASSETS such as FAVICON, IMAGES 

    ** files from PUBLIC FOLDER can be directly used inside COMPONENTS without SPECIFYING RELATIVE PATH 

  - src/index.js: entry point file which has REACT RENDER CODES 

  - public/index.html: is the entry file with a div with ID = ROOT and a script tag which points to src/index.js 

    ** index.html can be also put OUTSIDE the PUBLIC FOLDER
