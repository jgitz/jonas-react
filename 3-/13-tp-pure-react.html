<!-- 
..... react can also be written inside HTML file using REACT SCRIPTS 

- TWO SCRIPTS are taken from REACT DOC inorder to bring react into our html file 

  - one script is to get CORE REACT funcitonalities like useState(), useEffect() etc

  - 2nd script is used to bring REACT-DOM functionalities like RENDERING... that will allow to work on DOM 

** in HTML.... JSX WON'T work..... so we use DOM MANIPULATION METHODS.....

  <script>// 3 this script is where we write react codes define components and RENDER THEM 

   /* 4 rendering app component */ 
   function App () {

    return React.createElement("p", null, "This is App component") // 5 the first argument creates P TAG....SECOND ARGUMENT is for PROPS to pass to the component.... THIRD ARGUMENT is the CONTENT to be added to the tag
   }

   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")); /* 6 REACT DOM function to set ROOT element inside which you want to render components */

   root.render(React.createElement(App)); /* 7 
   only now the APP COMPONENT gets RENDERED.... RENDER happens because of REACTDOM function which is assigned to the ROOT
   */

  // ** to use useEffect.... use React.useEffect(arrow function, dependency array)

  // ** to use useState....use React.useState()
