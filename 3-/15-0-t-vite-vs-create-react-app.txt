..... there are 2 ways in which you can SET up REACT PROJECTS....

1) use CREATE-REACT-APP: 

  - is a STARTER KIT to start react projects 

  - the kit includes tools like 

    - ESLINT(to show error underlines and explanation when hovering over errors)
    - PRETTIER (to format code)
    - JEST (testing)
    - WEBPACK (for module bundling)
    - BABEL
    - development SERVER (to run the project)

  - DISADVANTAGES

    - old and OBSOLETE 
    - WEBPACK is an OUTDATED TOOL 
     
  ** now create-react-app is used to only do EXPERIMENTAL REACT PROJECTS 

  **** REAL WORLD PROJECTS are done using VITE 

2) VITE: is a MODERN BUILD TOOL which contain a TEMPLATE to set REACT APPLICATIONS 

  - VITE is new way to BUILD REALWORLD REACT APPS 

  - VITE is EXTREMELY FAST  

  - VITE DON'T COMES WITH tools like... ESLINT, TESTING LIBRARY , PRETTIER.. etc

  - DISADVANTAGE 

    - tricky to set ESLINT in VITE
